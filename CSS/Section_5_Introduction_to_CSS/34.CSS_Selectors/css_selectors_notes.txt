1. Element selector:

    in style.css if we write 
        h1{color: red;}
    it will change all the h1 tags in html into red color

2. class selector

    here class is nothing but the Attribute we adding to html tag
    ex: <h2> class="red-text"> Red </h2>

    in style.css we will be using this as 

        .red-text{color="red";}             ---> dot before the class name is mandatory without the gap.

    functionality:lets group the all the html elements into a class
    so, its used to grouping the elements in your html file to apply the same css rule to all of them. 

    Ex:
        css file:
            .red-text{color:red;}

        html file:
            <h2 class="red-text"> Heading 2</h2>        ---> Turn into red color
            <h3> Heading 3 </h3>
            <p class="red-text">Paragraph</p>           ---> Turn into red color


3. Id selector:

    It has its own special symbol ---> #

        #main{color: red}           ---> no space after the # and the ID Attribute
    
    html file:
        <h2 id="main">Red</h2>
        <h2>Green</h2>
        <h2>Blue</h2>

    It works similar to the class selector. 
    Q. But what is the difference between the class and id?
        class selector - can be applied to many elements in html file.
        ID selector - can be applied to a one element in a single html file.

    in one html file there will not exist duplicate id attribute name - It should be completedly "unique"

4. Attribute selector:

    in an html tag we can write as many attributes as we like.
    so we had attributes such as id="" or class="" or draggable="" or src="" or href="" or alt="" and whole bunch more.

    Now we can select these elements that have particular attributes or particular attribute values by using below notation.
    Ex:
        p[draggable]{
            color:red                   ---> here this notation is saying that, select all the paragraph elements with attribute as draggable and apply the css style to it.
        }

    here 
    p ---> html element that we want to select.
    attribute ---> here we will be writing the attribute that we want to write.
    {color:red} ---> this is the css style.

    Ex:

    css file:
        p[draggable="flase"]{color:red;}

    html file:
        <p draggable="true">  Drag me </p>
        <p draggable="false">  Don't Drag me </p>       ---> this paragraph will trun into red color
        <p draggable="false">  Don't Drag me </p>       ---> this paragraph will trun into red color

    basically in above example css file is checking for the combination of p tag and attribute draggable="false" and aplying the style to them.

5. Universal selector:

    it is really simple just add astrisk

        *{
            color:red;
        }
    here * means select all 
    and when we apply this it doesnt matter what class, what id, what attribute set which different element...
    it will select all and apply to everything where the style sheet is active.
