The Cascade - Specificity and Inheritance:
------------------------------------------

    Just like python, CSS will update with the latest style written

    like:
        1st external file css will apply 
        2nd it will check wether the internal file is having any style or not
            if yes it will override the existing css.

CSS Level of Importance:
------------------------
    It is based on 4 pillars:
        1. Position
        2. Specificity
        3. Type
        4. Importance


    1. Position:
    -----------
    The lower level or latest css style will override the upper level or old.

        li{
            color: red;     ---> This is the old/upper level css
            color: blue;    ---> This is the latest/lower level css -- This will overide the upper css
        }
        So, the lower down the file the rule is more important it is.

    2. Specificity:
    ---------------
    It is like little bit of filtering and applying

    ex:
    <li id="first-id" class="first-class" draggagble>

        li {color: blue;}                   ---> element level, This will for all the li elements
        .first-class {color: red;}          ---> class, this will apply for the elements having this class - basicallly as we know class is used to group the elements 
                                                so, here it will apply the color for the group of elements having the class as .first-class
        li[draggable] {color: purple;}      --->attirbute: Using the attribute we can apply the css, this is also almost like class but different
        #first-id {color: orange;}          --->id, Since is unique css will be applicable for the one id element

        From the above example what we can say is 
        at level 1 - everything will be in blue color
        at level 2 - few elements will change from blue to red
        at level 3 - among those red and blue, few will chnage into purple 
        at last level - only item having that id will chnage into orange remaining will be having their own colors

        But here all the above items present in single html then that will turn into ornage since id is lastly applied and that id is exist in that html

        The more spcific it is the more css rule will apply

    3. Type:
    --------
    It is like applying css based on how we are applying the css type
        like External, internal or inline

        as we know external will applicable for all the we pages
        internal will applicable only for that page and 
        inline is applicable for that one particular element 

        here the level of execution is External > Internal > inline
        Ex:
            <link href="./style.css" rel="stylesheet">      --->External
            <style> </styel>                                ---> Internal
            <h1 style=" ">Hello</h1>                        ---> inline

    4. Importance:
    --------------
    Ex:
        color: red;
        color: green !importance;           ---> This !important Keyword will ensure that this will be the most important rule relative to that element

        It doesnt matter whther the upper rule is id or inline or it is a very bottom line 
        the rule withe keyword !important will execute as a last level
